# SQLite Database for Authors and Books

# Overview

# Step 1: Create Tables  

This project sets up a SQLite database to store information about authors and books. The database includes two tables: Authors and Books. It also demonstrates various SQL queries to retrieve specific information from these tables.

# Tables

Authors
The Authors table stores information about the authors, including their first name, last name, and nationality.

Books
The Books table stores information about the books, including the title, author, description, and a reference to the author in the Authors table.
